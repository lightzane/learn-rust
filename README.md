## How this project was created

(Similar to `cargo new <package_name>`)

But if you already have a folder created and want to initialize on current directory:

```sh
# cargo init [options] [path]
cargo init . # initialize in root/current directory
cargo init --name package_name . # defaults current directory name
```
